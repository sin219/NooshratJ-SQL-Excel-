# Environmental & Population Impact Analysis (Excel)

This project delivers a quantitative analysis of CO₂ emissions across U.S. states, economic sectors, and time periods, using Excel-based data modeling and interactive dashboarding to surface meaningful environmental patterns and comparisons.

## Project Objective
To evaluate how CO₂ emissions vary by **sector, geography, and population context**, and to translate raw environmental data into structured, decision-ready insights through Excel-driven analysis.

## Analytical Approach
- Aggregated and analyzed CO₂ emissions data across multiple dimensions, including **state, sector, and year**.
- Applied **ratio-based normalization** (e.g., emissions relative to population and area) to enable fair, standardized comparisons.
- Leveraged **PivotTables, calculated fields, and slicers** to support dynamic exploration of trends and outliers.
- Designed an interactive dashboard to synthesize complex data into a clear, visual analytical narrative.

## Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Excel  
- PivotTables and PivotCharts
